							Invo.dev is a minimal pdf invoice generation tool.
							It's designed to be simple and easy to use, so you
							can focus on what you do. It was born out of a
							personal need to generate PDF invoices without the
							overhead of a full billing solution.
							<br />
							<br />
							You can make feature suggestions or bug reports by
							emailing us at{' '}
							<Link href='mailto:support@invo.dev'>
								support@invo.dev

						<Text>
							To get started, simply navigate to{' '}
							<Link href='/new'>invo.dev/new</Link> where you will
							find a form to fill. Proceed to enter as many fields
							as you find necessary, and then click the "Generate
							invoice" button. After just a few seconds, a
							download should automatically start.

						<h2 className='mt-10 mb-4 text-2xl'>How it works</h2>
						<Text>
							The tool uses your submission to render a real, high
							quality PDF with Cloudflare's Browser Rendering API.
							Many popular PDF rendering solutions get this wrong
							by just rendering the content to an image,
							rasterizing every element to be opaque and
							unselectable. This is due to them attempting to
							render in a browser constrained environment. <br />
							<br />
							Invo.dev circumvents this by utilizing a headless
							cloud browser environment to print a sized page to
							PDF automatically without any hacks.
							<br />
							<br />
							This also sets Invo.dev up as a great platform for
							automated invoice generation as we can provide you
							PDFs asyncronously and in bulk.
